This rapo contains the front end that I am using for the app "Weather on the Road"
It is a web app developed in Angular with the help of Material UI
It shows a Google Map used to calculate the rout that user wants to go on, that it displays the weather along that route.
It also has a login screen, create account screen and profile page where the user can see his own history of the routes.
