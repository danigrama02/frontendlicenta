This rapo contains the front end that I am using for the app "Weather on the Road"
It is a web app developed in Angular with the help of Material UI
It shows a Google Map used to calculate the rout that user wants to go on, that it displays the weather along that route.
It also has a login screen, create account screen and profile page where the user can see his own history of the routes.

Usage : 
In order to run this app on your  local machine you need to have installed Node.js 20.2.0, than all you need to do is:
  - go into the licenta_front_end directory and open a Command Prompt
  - type npm install, in order to install all of the needed packages
  - than use the command ng serve in order to run it
